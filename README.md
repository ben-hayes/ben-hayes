I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Music at Queen Mary University of London’s Centre for Digital Music. My research focuses on signal-processing based deep learning techniques for audio synthesis. I am jointly supervised by Dr György Fazekas and Dr Charalampos Saitis.

Previously, I was a research scientist intern at Spotify (Music Intelligence), Sony CSL (Music Team), and Bytedance (Speech, Audio & Music Intelligence), and lead the music team at Jukedeck. I have also worked extensively as a music producer, and was a lecturer in Electronic & Produced Music at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London.
